# SkyCity - freeCodeCamp CSS Project 🌆

Welcome to **SkyCity**, a project I built while learning CSS concepts through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This project helped me explore how to use **CSS Variables** and **Gradients** to design visually appealing and scalable layouts.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ✅ How to define and use **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** for colors and layout
- ✅ Creating **linear and radial gradients** for backgrounds and building effects
- ✅ Organizing CSS code for better reuse and readability
- ✅ Structuring HTML with semantic tags

## 💡 Key Features

- 🎨 Dynamic color theming using CSS variables
- 🌈 Gradient skies and building textures
- 🧱 Reusable styles for modular building blocks

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
